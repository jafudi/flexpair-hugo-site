Jens has agile project experience as a data scientist (Tableau + R) as well as in data engineering (Python, Spark, Impala). Good collaboration and intercultural understanding are important values to him in his daily work. He is keen on building innovative yet solid predictive solutions.

Jens is holding a diploma degree in mathematics from Heidelberg University. His field of study included discrete optimization, partial differential equations and theoretical physics. After finishing his diploma, he joined PwC Switzerland in their risk advisory practice. Here Jens worked for a global banking client and implemented their group-wide KYC model for predicting the likelihood of money laundering. With the acquired deep knowledge in R, he then became the co-founder of the Swiss PwC Analytics team. He engaged in business development as well as recruiting and was one of the first to apply tools like Microsoft Azure Machine Learning and H20 on projects. He participated in conferences like the Deep Learning Summit 2015 in San Francisco.

Intending to dive deeper into the technical foundations of data science, Jens decided to join Accenture Digital Analytics in 2016. His projects with banking as well as sportswear manufacturing clients were focused on big data engineering. He participated in a training week in Apache Spark development and in the Deep Learning in Health Care Summit 2017. Jens is convinced that in order to be a good data scientist, you not only have to know your data but be enthusiastic about the insights that can be derived from it. That is why he decided to join the Lufthansa spin-off #zeroG in 2017 and has been working there as a Lead Data Scientist since.
