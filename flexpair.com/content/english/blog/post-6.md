## Carbon dioxide and waste reduction

- we go beyond the obvious "less business travel" argument
- no need for a second or third notebook, because Flexpair fully runs in your favorite browser
- Not so fun fact: Did you know that the production of a notebook until you switch it on the first time produces as much CO2 as driving about 1200 km with your car?
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS with lightweight LXQt desktop requires only 1 GB of RAM (often available for free)

## Inclusion through maximum flexibility

- looks and sexual identity does not matter on Flexpair ⚧️🦄
- let anxiety related to being in front of a camera or among people not stop you 🎗️🧘 
- care for your child and about your career 👶🌡️
- source your top talent worldwide 🌍🧑🏿‍💻

## Personal boundaries and data protection

- Flexpair deliberately does not offer video conferencing. Because remote work should not feel like being a lone wolf in one moment and like Big Brother in the next.
- if you really need to give someone remote access to your local machine, please consider using [TeamViewer](https://www.teamviewer.com/en/) or comparable established solutions.
- full control over which data are stored and where
- a TLS certificate is automatically created and renewed for you
